## Study Projects
In this repository, you will find solved exercises, applications, and APIs in Go.

### API_OPPORTUNITIES
This project includes the implementation of a complete job opportunities API, with endpoints for searching, creating, editing, and deleting opportunities, developed in Golang. The project is fully structured and documented, and it utilizes libraries such as Gin, Swagger, GORM, and SQLite. To use the API, you must have GCC installed on your machine. The Swagger documentation is fully functional and can be used to test the application.

- Use of Go-Gin as a router for route management
- Implementation of SQLite as the database for the API
- Use of GORM for database communication
- Integration of Swagger for API documentation and testing
- Creation of a modern package structure for project organization
- Implementation of automated tests to ensure API quality
